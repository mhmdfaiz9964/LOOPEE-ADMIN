# RECENT CHANGES & API KEY IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

## 1. RECENT CHANGES: CATEGORY TYPE (GROCERY / FOOD)

We have successfully added a new feature to distinguish categories by type: **Grocery** or **Food**. This allows for better organization and filtering of categories within the application.

### Changes Made:
- **Database**: The `vendor_categories` collection in Firestore now supports a `type` field (values: `grocery` or `food`).
- **Create Category Page**: Added a dropdown menu to select the specific type when creating a new category.
- **Edit Category Page**: Added a dropdown menu to view and modify the type of existing categories.
- **Category List Page**: Added a new "Type" column to the categories table to display the selected type. The search and sort functionality now supports this new column.
- **Localization**: Added translation keys for "Food" and "Grocery" in the language files for multi-language support.

### How It Works:
1.  **Selection**: When an admin creates or edits a category, they select "Grocery" or "Food" from the new dropdown menu.
2.  **Storage**: This selection is saved as a string field named `type` in the `vendor_categories` document in your Firebase Cloud Firestore.
3.  **Usage in App**: The mobile application and website can now read this `type` field to separate categories (e.g., showing only "Food" categories in the food delivery section and "Grocery" categories in the mart section).

## 2. API KEYS IMPLEMENTATION

The application uses various API keys (Google Maps, Firebase, Payment Gateways) which are managed directly through the Admin Panel's settings. These keys are stored in the Firestore database (`settings` collection) and fetched by the app as needed.

### A. Google Maps API Key
This key is used for map rendering, location picking, and direction services.
1.  **Navigate to**: Admin Panel > Settings > Global Settings.
2.  **Locate Section**: "Google Map API Key" (usually at the bottom or middle of the page).
3.  **Input**: Enter your Google Maps API Key in the field provided.
4.  **Save**: Click the "Save" button.
    *   *Backend Action*: This updates the `settings/googleMapKey` document in Firestore.
    *   *App Usage*: The mobile/web apps fetch this document to initialize the Google Maps SDK.

### B. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) / Notifications
For push notifications to work (e.g., order updates), you need to configure FCM.
1.  **Navigate to**: Admin Panel > Settings > Notification Settings.
2.  **Sender ID**: Enter your Firebase Sender ID.
3.  **Service JSON**: Upload the `firebase-service-account.json` file (generated from Firebase Console > Project Settings > Service Accounts).
4.  **Save**: This securely stores the credentials to allow the server to send notifications.

### C. Payment Gateway Keys (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
1.  **Navigate to**: Admin Panel > Settings > Payment Settings.
2.  **Select Gateway**: Choose the payment method (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay).
3.  **Input Keys**: Enter the Public/Publishable Key and Secret Key provided by your payment processor.
4.  **Toggle**: Enable the payment method and optionally "Sandbox Mode" for testing.
5.  **Save**: These keys are stored in Firestore for the app to process payments securely.

### D. General Firebase Config
The Admin Panel itself connects to Firebase using a configuration that is typically found in the code (often in `js/config.js` or `layouts/app.blade.php`), or sometimes dynamically loaded. If you need to change the project the Admin Panel connects to, you would update the Firebase initialization snippet with your new project's `apiKey`, `authDomain`, `projectId`, etc.
